					<h3>Mercury's surface temperatures reach temperature extremes on both sides of the spectrum. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, the temperatures during the day can reach 800°F (430°C). Because Mercury lacks an atmosphere, it cannot retain that heat at night, and temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C). With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85 percent of the planet's radius. 

						<br><br>Our experts here at Space Odyssey believe that Mercury is not a profitable venture for the company. Because of the extreme heat that must be endured for mining expeditions, we believe that expeditions to Mercury to mine will not end up being profitable due to the extensive amount of research and Development that must be put in place in order to begin. These costs coupled with the relatively low project yield of such an expedition make it highly unlikely for such an expedition to proceed.
						
						<br><br>Space Odyssey has no further plans to visit Mercury.

					<h3>Venus is often called Earth’s twin because of its similarity in size and density(around 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers) across). That is where the similarities end, however, as Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and is perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. The thick atmosphere causes Venus to be the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius). Venus also has a crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth. Like Earth, Venus has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust.

				<h1>Mars!
				</h1>
				<h2>
					<br><br>Mars is the fourth planet from the sun in our solar system and is often referred to as the "Red Planet." It is a rocky, terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere and a surface that is dotted with impact craters, valleys, and mountains. Mars is roughly half the size of Earth and has a much colder climate, with temperatures ranging from -80 degrees Celsius at its highest to -140 degrees Celsius at its lowest. Despite its inhospitable conditions, Mars has long been the subject of scientific study and exploration due to its proximity to Earth and the possibility of finding evidence of past or present life on the planet. In recent years, there have been several missions by space agencies around the world to study Mars and lay the groundwork for future human exploration.
					<br><br>Easy access to space travel to Mars could have numerous commercial benefits. Firstly, it could open up new opportunities for the exploration and utilization of the planet's natural resources, such as minerals and water ice, which could be used to support future human settlements or as raw materials for manufacturing processes. Secondly, it could also provide a new frontier for tourism, with people eager to experience the unique environment and beauty of Mars. Thirdly, it could provide a new market for research and development of cutting-edge technologies, such as space-based solar power, life support systems, and interplanetary transportation systems. Fourthly, it could provide a new venue for international cooperation and competition, as countries work together to establish a presence on Mars and engage in joint ventures to harness its resources. Overall, the development of cost-effective and reliable access to Mars has the potential to bring about a new era of economic and technological growth.

				<h1>Jupiter Description!</h1>
				<h2>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of approximately 86,881 miles (139,822 km) at its equator. It is a gas giant, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a small rocky core surrounded by a dense atmosphere and multiple layers of clouds. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and a massive system of rings, as well as more than 79 moons, the largest of which is Ganymede. It rotates quickly, with a day on Jupiter lasting just under 10 hours, and its fast rotation causes its equatorial region to bulge out, making the planet noticeably oblate. Jupiter is known for its distinctive Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm that has been raging for at least 400 years. Despite its inhospitable nature, Jupiter holds great scientific interest due to its size and the insights it can provide into the formation of our solar system and the behavior of gas giants in general.

					<br><br>Jupiter and its moons hold several commercial values that could be tapped into in the future. Firstly, the abundant hydrogen and helium in Jupiter's atmosphere could be used as a source of fuel for interplanetary spacecraft. Secondly, the moons of Jupiter, particularly Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, are believed to have large reserves of water ice, which could serve as a valuable resource for future human settlements in space. Thirdly, the moons of Jupiter are also of scientific interest due to their potential to host life and could be a source of new discoveries and breakthroughs in astrobiology. Fourthly, Jupiter's strong magnetic field and radiation environment could be used for advanced technological development and testing, such as for radiation-hardened electronics or as a location to study the interaction between charged particles and magnetic fields				</h2>
