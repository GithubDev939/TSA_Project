					<h3>Mercury's surface temperatures reach temperature extremes on both sides of the spectrum. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, the temperatures during the day can reach 800°F (430°C). Because Mercury lacks an atmosphere, it cannot retain that heat at night, and temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C). With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85 percent of the planet's radius. 

						Our experts here at Space Odyssey believe that Mercury is not a profitable venture for the company. Because of the extreme heat that must be endured for mining expeditions, we believe that expeditions to Mercury to mine will not end up being profitable due to the extensive amount of research and Development that must be put in place in order to begin. These costs coupled with the relatively low project yield of such an expedition make it highly unlikely for such an expedition to proceed.
						
						Space Odyssey has no further plans to visit Mercury.

					<h3>Venus is often called Earth’s twin because of its similarity in size and density(around 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers) across). That is where the similarities end, however, as Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and is perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. The thick atmosphere causes Venus to be the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius). Venus also has a crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth. Like Earth, Venus has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust.
